Turn ES6 code in to ES5 code
babel-loader: teaches babel how to work with webpack
babel-core: knows how to take in code, parse it, and generate some output files
babel-preset-env: ruleset for telling babel exactly what pieces of ES6/ES7
  syntax to look for, and how to turn it into ES5 code
=> .babelrc: whenever babel loads up, it looks at .babelrc -> it will see that it's
  supposed to run babel-preset-env
